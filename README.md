## Architecture Overview

### System Architecture
Edvance follows a modern **decoupled architecture** with a clear separation between the frontend and backend systems, communicating exclusively through RESTful APIs.

### API Design
- **RESTful API** — Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for resource operations
- **Resource-based URLs** — Logical URL structure following REST conventions
- **JSON Response Format** — Consistent JSON responses across all endpoints
- **HTTP Status Codes** — Proper status codes for success, errors, and validation
- **API Versioning** — Structured for future version support

### Authentication Architecture
- **Token-based Authentication** — Laravel Sanctum for stateless API authentication
- **JWT Integration** — JSON Web Tokens for secure session management
- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)** — Middleware-enforced permissions per user type
- **Multi-guard System** — Separate authentication guards for different user types

### Real-time Architecture
- **WebSocket Layer** — Pusher for server-side real-time events
- **Client Socket** — Socket.io for frontend real-time communication
- **Event Broadcasting** — Laravel events broadcast to connected clients
- **Presence Channels** — Track online users in live sessions

### Payment Architecture
- **Payment Gateway Abstraction** — Unified interface for Stripe and PayPal
- **Webhook Handlers** — Async payment confirmation processing
- **Transaction Logging** — Complete audit trail for all payments
- **Currency Handling** — Multi-currency support with conversion

### File Storage Architecture
- **Public Disk Storage** — Laravel filesystem for media files
- **Organized Directories** — Separate folders for profiles, CVs, videos, thumbnails
- **URL Generation** — Dynamic URL generation for stored files
- **File Validation** — Server-side type and size validation

### Database Architecture
- **Relational Design** — Normalized database schema with proper relationships
- **Eloquent Relationships** — HasMany, BelongsTo, MorphMany for related data
- **Soft Deletes** — Preserve data integrity with soft deletion
- **Query Optimization** — Eager loading and indexed queries

### Security Architecture
- **Password Hashing** — Bcrypt encryption for passwords
- **CORS Configuration** — Cross-origin resource sharing rules
- **Rate Limiting** — Protection against brute force attacks
- **Input Validation** — Server-side validation for all inputs
